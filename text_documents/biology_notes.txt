#### Communities (7.1.1)

An individual is part of a species, but lives in its habitat within a population.

Many different populations interact in the same habitat, creating a community. The populations are often dependent on each other.

An ecosystem is the interaction of a community with non-living (abiotic) parts of the environment. Organisms are adapted to live in the conditions of their environment.

Organisms which need the same resources compete for it.

* There can be competition within a species or between different species.
* Plants may compete for light, space, water and mineral ions.
* Animals may compete for space, food, water and mating partners.

Interdependence describes how organisms in a community depend on other organisms for vital services.

* These include for food, shelter and reproduction (pollination, seed dispersal), e.g. birds take shelter in trees, flowers are pollinated with the help of bees.
* The removal or addition of a species to the community can affect the populations of others greatly, as it changes prey or predator numbers
* A stable community is one where all the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) factors are in balance.

* As a result the population sizes remain roughly constant.

* When they are lost it is very difficult to replace them.

* Examples include tropical rainforests, oak woodlands and coral reefs.

### Abiotic Factors (7.1.2)

An abiotic factor is a non-living factor. You need to be able to explain the effect of a change in an abiotic factor.

Abiotic factors which can affect a community:

1. Light intensity * Light is required for photosynthesis.

* The rate of photosynthesis affects the rate at which the plant grows.

* Plants can be food sources or shelter for many organisms.

2. Temperature

* Temperature affects the rate of photosynthesis.

3. Moisture levels

* Both plants and animals need water to survive.

4. Soil pH and mineral content

* Soil pH affects the rate of decay and therefore how fast mineral ions return to soil (which are then taken up by other plants).
